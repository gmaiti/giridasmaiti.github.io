Dehydration melting in subduction zones often produces cold plumes, initiated by Rayleigh-Taylor
 instabilities in the buoyant partially molten zones lying above the dipping subducting slabs. We 
 use scaled laboratory experiments to demonstrate how the slab dip (α) can control the evolution of 
 such plumes. For α > 0°, Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities evolve as two orthogonal waves, one trench 
 perpendicular with wavelength λL and the other one trench parallel with wavelength λT (λT > λL). We 
 show that two competing processes, (1) λL-controlled updip advection of partially molten materials 
 and (2) λT/λL interference, determine the modes of plume growth. The λT/λL interference gives rise to
 an areal distribution of plumes (Mode 1), whereas advection leads to a linear distribution of plumes 
 (Mode 2) at the upper fringe of the partially molten layer. The λT wave instabilities do not grow when 
 α exceeds a threshold value (α* = 30°). For α > α*, λL-driven advection takes the control to produce 
 exclusively Mode 2 plumes. We performed a series of 2-D and 3-D computational fluid dynamics simulations
 to test the criticality of slab dip in switching the Mode 1 to Mode 2 transition at α*. We discuss the 
 effects of viscosity ratio (R) and the density contrast (Δρ) between the source layers and ambient mantle,
 source layer thickness (Ts), and slab velocity (Us) on the development of cold plumes. Finally, we discuss
 the areal versus linear distributions of volcanoes from natural subduction zones as possible examples of 
 Mode 1 versus Mode 2 plume products.
